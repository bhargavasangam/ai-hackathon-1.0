    <h1>Linear programming</h1>
    <p>Linear Programming is an optimization technique that aims to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints</p>
    <p>Objective Function: A linear function we want to optimize (e.g., minimize cost).
Decision Variables: Values we can adjust (e.g., how many units of material to buy from each supplier).
Constraints: Linear inequalities or equalities that limit our decisions (e.g., supply capacity, storage limits).</p>
