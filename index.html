    <h1>Linear programming</h1>
    <p>Linear Programming is an optimization technique that aims to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints</p>
    <p>Objective Function: A linear function we want to optimize (e.g., minimize cost).
Decision Variables: Values we can adjust (e.g., how many units of material to buy from each supplier).
Constraints: Linear inequalities or equalities that limit our decisions (e.g., supply capacity, storage limits).</p>
    <p>Demand
Concrete demand: 500 units total over the project timeline.
Steel demand: 300 units total over the project timeline.
Costs
Cost of Concrete from Supplier A: $50 per unit.
Cost of Concrete from Supplier B: $55 per unit.
Cost of Steel from Supplier A: $100 per unit.
Cost of Steel from Supplier B: $95 per unit.
Supplier Capacity
Supplier A can provide up to 400 units of Concrete and 200 units of Steel.
Supplier B can provide up to 300 units of Concrete and 300 units of Steel.
Additional Constraints
Storage Limit: The site can hold a maximum of 600 total units of material (concrete + steel) at any given time.
Project Demand Must Be Met: Must meet or exceed the total demand for each material.</p>
